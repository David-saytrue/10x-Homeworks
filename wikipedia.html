      <h1>Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
        development can range from developing a **simple**
        <i>single static page</i> of plain text to **complex** web applications,
        electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
        list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
        engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
        client-side/server-side scripting, <mark>Web server</mark> and network
        security configuration, and <del>e-commerce development</del>. The
        standard version is <ins>1.0</ins><sup>v1</sup>. This includes the
        H<sub>2</sub>O protocol, <em>among other things</em>.

      <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>

      <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
      <p>
        Tim Berners-Lee created the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> in 1989 at
        CERN. The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the
        automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with
        institutions and <em>various global organizations</em>. Consequently,
        <mark>HTML</mark> was developed in 1993. Web 1.0 is described as the
        <b>first paradigm</b> wherein users could
        <del>only view material</del> and <ins>provide a small amount</ins> of
        information. Core protocols were HTTP, HTML and URI. The original spec
        was version 1.0<sup>a</sup> and used the code N<sub>2</sub>.
        <i>It was a read-only environment.</i>
      </p>

      <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
      <p>
        Web 2.0, a term <b>popularised by Dale Dougherty</b>, marks a shift in
        internet usage, emphasizing <strong>interactivity</strong>. Web 2.0
        introduced <em>increased user engagement</em> and
        <mark>communication</mark>. It <del>evolved from the static</del>,
        read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for
        <ins>engagement</ins>. It is often referred to as a user-focused,
        <i>read-write online network</i>. Users now have access to a platform
        that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files,
        images, and movies. This new era is called Web 2.0<sup>b</sup> and uses
        the data format P<sub>4</sub>.
      </p>

      <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
      <p>
        Web 3.0, considered the <strong>third and current version</strong> of
        the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a
        <i>complete redesign</i> of the web. Key features include the
        integration of metadata, <b>precise information delivery</b>, and
        improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests.
        Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized
        <del>database</del>, <ins>providing more functionality</ins> than
        traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on
        their preferences. The ideas involve identifying data sources,
        connecting them for <em>efficiency</em>, and creating user profiles.
        This version is sometimes also known as <mark>Semantic Web</mark>. It is
        the next generation, Web 3.0<sup>c</sup>, using the marker
        C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.
